Selective Lambda Lifting

# Title

- Working topic for my internship: Nested CPR
- Long history, Joachim worked on it in 2014 when he was an intern
- Never made it into GHC HEAD because of complexity and unclear performance implications

# CPR -- Motivation

- HAskell programs allcoate like crazy
- Like JAva's Integer, Haskell's Ints are boxed (and lifted!)
- Unfold defs of * and - to see that
- recursive case: we return a heap-allocated box only to immediately unwrap and discard it again
- prefer the following form with auxiliary function (worker) and a wrapper
- worker/wrapper transform yields better form

# worker/wrapper

- Generally quite simple: Wrap original body in case expression, replacing outer product type constructor by unboxed tuple -> worker
- In the wrapper, call worker and seemingly reverse the transformation, reintroducing the box
- Wrapper inlines at call sites and offers 'custom calling convention', highly likely that box cancels away with use site
- In the example, we perform case-of-case, then case-of-known constructor
- Then we inline the now non-recursive and small fac. Immediately see that case-of-known-constructor is applicable and cancel away another box
- WW can also exploit strictness information, so that we finally arrive at the previous program 
- Always sound

# beneficial?

- Only beneficial when it has the CPR property, i.e., when the outer case entirely cancels away.
- Example where that is not the case
- Supplying a Lit and the using the *boxed* result of eval (like when mapping to a [Int]) results in an increase in allocations
- PAthological example
- Pretty straight-forward abstract interpretation

# Nested CPR -- Motivation

- A common scheme is some recursive computation in IO
- Example lifts fac into IO
- PErforming CPR leaves behind an unpleasant boxed Int
- But the second component obiously has CPR property!
- We'd much rather like the second version here
- Welcome to nested CPR

# When to apply this

- There are some additional complications compared to the non-nested case
- Unwrapping more than one constructor can change strictness properties of function
- One might be tempted to transform f to f', but that is unsound
- Similar, but different is the speculative aspect

# Closure conversion vs. Lambda lifting

- Both are code gen strategies that translate local functions in terms of global ones and auxiliary heap allocs
- Closure Conversion: References to free variables lowered as fields accesses on a closure record containing all FVs
- Lambda Lifting: Convert free variables into parameters, supplied as additional arguments at call sites
