Selective Lambda Lifting

# Motivation

- What is lambda lifting?
- Consider Haskell Code
- LL will turn local function definitions into top-level ones, turning free variables into parameters
- former free variables are additional arguments at call sites
- Lambda lifting is famous as a code generation strategy for functional languages
- But GHC currently does closure conversion, allocates a closure for g closing over a
- Sometimes it's beneficial to do LL instead, as this example demonstrates (non-allocating), 50% speedup
- Also examples that get substantially slower, like the following  
  - Thunk for h, closes over g and n
  - Lambda lifting gets rid of closure environment for g
  - But h now closes over a b and n, so grew by one word
  - Worse: g closure allocated once, but h closure allocated multiple times
  - 10% slowdown
- On Simon's wish list for quite some time
- So I went ahead and implemented it
- Goal of paper: work out when a lambda lift is beneficial

# Closure conversion vs. Lambda lifting

- Both are code gen strategies that translate local functions in terms of global ones and auxiliary heap allocs
- Closure Conversion: References to free variables lowered as fields accesses on a closure record containing all FVs
- Lambda Lifting: Convert free variables into parameters, supplied as additional arguments at call sites
